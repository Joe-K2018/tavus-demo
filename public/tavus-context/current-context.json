How much capacity do they need, and how can they optimize their cloud real estate? Which of their legacy approaches do they need to leave behind? What is the business reason for moving in the first place?\n\nBy thinking of a cloud migration similarly to moving to a new house, FIs can ensure an effective and efficient transition.\n\n#### Four steps to a successful cloud migration\n\nHere are four ways FIs can ensure an optimal cloud migration that delivers benefits to employees, processes, clients and the organization itself.\n\n1. **Take a people-first approach.** It’s easy to get consumed by the technical aspects of a cloud migration: tooling, upgrades, depreciations, multi-cloud options, application programming interfaces (API), security, etc. However, FIs need to balance these technology concerns with the business changes the cloud entails and enables, both to reduce costs associated with the technology infrastructure and optimize revenue and profit margins.\n\nFor instance, which dedicated teams will stand up the service, and who will perform ongoing maintenance and support? How will new business applications and use cases be onboarded to achieve more value from the foundational cloud solution?\n\nWe worked with an FI client to implement a financial reporting solution that incorporated a cloud-native data management component. Keeping in mind business stakeholders’ needs for dashboards and reports that enable decision making based on a variety of key indicators, we introduced a mechanism to standardize the client data, which was expected to arrive in varying shapes and sizes from multiple locations. Without these standards, people would get confused by the meaning of the downstream analytics.\n\nAnother way businesses can put people first — while also reducing costs and cycle times — is to automate maintenance activities. One of the largest benefits of the cloud is the ability to create resources with API calls or embedded APIs in tools and software. This puts the focus on the business outcomes rather than the updates, themselves. By automating repetitive tasks, people can focus on value-added activities, which ensures the business is taking full advantage of the cloud.\n\n2. **Focus on delivering value and business outcomes.** Clearly define why you are moving to the cloud in the first place, with the help and agreement of key stakeholders. Document the business use case and continually update it to keep up with new businesses and technology circumstances, including business engagement, automation, data, value, architecture and visibility. FIs that understand and document cloud migration goals on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual cadence are best positioned to adapt quickly to change.\n\nIt’s essential to understand that the simple act of moving to the cloud is not a guarantee of cost savings — in fact, many FIs find themselves initially increasing their tech investment. Additional measures can mitigate the cost increase, however. We worked with a large payments client that had partially moved to the cloud to reduce its costs by 50%. By moving fully to the cloud, it no longer needed to maintain its legacy environment, which not only reduced costs but also enabled additional value-added capabilities and innovation via cloud-based automation and AI.\n\nFIs should also consider how business and market requirements may change over time. For example, we worked with a client that wanted to adopt many new sources of third-party data and incorporate new algorithms to find and retain new clients. By connecting the dots, the FI was able to make more meaningful decisions regarding product and service differentiation that led to a 25% increase in new clients and reduced attrition by 15%.\n\nBy clearly defining business use cases, FIs can better understand where cloud investments should be made, as well as when to stop, start and continue these investments. For instance, we worked with a top-10 FI to augment its data and cloud capabilities to achieve a more holistic view of its data to enable more consistent cross-selling and upselling of products and services across channels and achieve greater share of wallet.\n\nThe firm improved how it models customer profiles to enable highly-targeted marketing campaigns, while also improving the customer experience across the products and services portfolio. We then partnered with the FI to centralize the environment that allows internal business units to easily analyze and access data.\n\n3. **Apply cloud-native thinking to the new environment.** Many clients try to move all of their on-premises infrastructure to the cloud simultaneously. This is the equivalent of trying to move all of your studio apartment belongings to a house, where they are ill-fitting and stylistically inappropriate. To optimize cloud scalability, FIs must realize that architectural decisions for databases, firewalls and security that are used on-premises are often suboptimal when deployed on the cloud.\n\nWhile businesses might think they’re avoiding disruption by using their on-premises approaches, doing so ultimately inflates costs, reduces scalability and eventually reduces business outcomes. Reviewing cloud-native tooling and capabilities results in a more cost-effective and secure solution overall. If the decision is a third-party tool, make sure it can be automated to avoid errors, additional cycle time and excess headcount to the cloud platform.\n\n4. **Go green while maintaining agility.** Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) are  three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business. FIs are not only measuring other companies’ ESG, but are also being measured on their own ESG compliance. The growing demand for cloud infrastructure has led to a dramatic increase in energy consumption. For example, Google reported in 2019 that its [data center electricity use had tripled in the last six years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2020/02/24/techs-green-pose-gets-less-and-less-convincing/?sh=2bea99da69d0), a 20% annual rate of increase that far surpassed any other industry. Due to this increase and overall business sentiment on ESG, organizations are more deeply examining their energy demands. This is also due to the exponential growth of cloud service vendors’ data centers.\n\nTo achieve greener cloud computing, FIs must include low-power consumption as a requirement in their design, production and use of digital spaces. A green cloud solution such as [Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/dynamic-voltage-and-frequency-scaling) can reduce energy consumption and increase resource utilization, leading to energy savings, significant reductions in enterprise operational costs and greater business value.\n\n\nFIs can more effectively and efficiently serve clients with a streamlined cloud migration that transitions people, processes and the organization itself in a way that optimizes business opportunities. By viewing cloud migration in a business light, they’ll ensure a bright future in their new cloud home.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n##### Cognizant Insights Team\n\n![Cognizant](https://cognizant.scene7.com/is/image/cognizant/cognizant-insights-team-author-square)\n\n* * *\n\nWe’re here to offer you practical and unique solutions to today’s most pressing technology challenges.

With the prospect of clinical trials grinding to a halt and putting participants’ health at risk, it became critical to take a new look at alternatives to the traditional clinical trials approach.\n\n[So began the age of decentralized clinical trials](https://www.cognizant.com/perspectives/reinventing-clinical-trials-for-a-stay-at-home-world) and the emerging models that enable research participation outside of traditional clinical site environments for both trial participants and researchers. With increased demand for supporting decentralized clinical trials, technology is evolving to meet [the needs of life sciences researchers and patients](https://www.cognizant.com/perspectives/making-decentralized-clinical-trials-work-three-must-haves). More sensors, more data, more engaging ways of interacting with trial participants — it’s all part of the future of clinical trials.\n\n#### The way forward for clinical trials\n\nHere are six ways we see technology better serving researchers and patients in 2021 and beyond.\n\n1. **More access to patient data through devices.** Collecting timely data from patients if they aren’t reporting to a clinical trial site can feel like an insurmountable challenge. Our inboxes are full, our lives are busy, and remembering to submit or report health metrics feels like one more easily forgotten task for patients.\n\nEnter consumer devices, such as fitness trackers and smart watches, as well as clinical devices like [ECG](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/diagnosing-a-heart-attack/electrocardiogram-ecg-or-ekg) s and pulse oximeters. Through passive data collection, these devices can raise a red flag indicating a need for follow-up or present an additional data point in research findings.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re currently working with a client to explore the use of a non-invasive sensor to periodically measure levels of potassium, which may serve as a risk indicator for patients on an oncology therapy. Additionally, features like push notifications can serve as a reminder to perform a protocol-related task, present progress or check in with the research team.\n\n2. **Better, safer patient experiences.** Clinical trial participants increasingly expect a consumer-like experience. They need easier, faster ways to schedule appointments, onboard and view critical information about their medication, therapy or medical device.\n\nWearable devices, companion apps and modern service design can reduce friction and elevate the human experience while also improving safety. With an elegantly connected solution, researchers can determine quickly when adverse events occur, pinpoint a specific population if needed, and adjust the study trajectory to improve outcomes for all patients.\n\nOn a recent client project, we helped develop a digital risk assessment for patients starting a new therapy. Using the tool, clinicians can develop a personalized patient starter pack, based on any pre-existing conditions, preferences and behaviors that are identified.\n\nFor example, since proper hydration is critical for safe use of the therapy, a smart water bottle that tracks water intake is now included in the starter kit for patients whose behavioral data reveals low hydration habits. In turn, care providers are notified when patients are not drinking enough water to support safe use of the product. This kind of personalized approach can impact engagement and patient safety.\n\n3. **New approaches to big datasets.** As more clinically validated devices become available, so does the potential for more data collection. Instead of collecting information every few weeks, researchers will be able to measure a wide range of data points as often as they choose. While this will reduce the administrative burden (no more scheduling site visits to collect data that can be gathered remotely), the increased data volume and velocity will pose new challenges. New processes and approaches to big data will help turn a firehose of information into results that lead to more efficient operational analysis and improved clinical insights.\n\nCloud-native platforms such as [Philips HealthSuite](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/innovation/about-health-suite) provide a foundational system of record with which analytical models and dashboards can be deployed to visualize study performance. [These platforms can be integrated](https://news.cognizant.com/2021-07-08-Philips-and-Cognizant-Collaborate-to-Introduce-Digital-Health-Solutions-to-Providers,-Researchers-and-Patients) with systems like our [Shared Investigator Platform](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/products-and-platforms/shared-investigator-platform) to share insights among study teams.\n\n4. **Better patient technical support.** Technology doesn’t always work how we expect; common household tech problems such as dropped Bluetooth connectivity could also have important consequences when a study or therapy relies on them. Depending on the patient population, there might be a significant learning curve for self-troubleshooting such issues, let alone getting up to speed on a new device.\n\nResearchers will need to develop new channels for supporting patients’ technology needs, including knowledge bases and AI chatbots, to keep patients — with their varied degrees of digital literacy — engaged, ultimately preventing drop-off.\n\n5. **The use of video and immersive content for patient education.** As patients learn the ins and outs of new devices necessary for study participation and familiarize themselves with their disease state and the study approach, researchers can use technology to communicate with patients in new ways. Video content can show patients how a drug or device is designed to work, so they can better visualize the potential health implications.\n\nImmersive content, such as interactive infographics and augmented reality solutions, can also help patients learn about the science behind a trial and what they need to know to participate. A cardboard box might have a QR code that launches a website displaying how to unbox the contents safely, or patients may be able to hold up their phones and have unboxing instructions overlaid directly on top of their phone’s camera feed.\n\nIn one recent use case, a life sciences company developed an interactive infographic, using a 200-page protocol document as source material, to accelerate training for investigators. The results from the training program were so successful that it was later converted to a patient education tool used during onboarding.\n\n6. **Connections through new community partnerships.** A benefit of decentralized clinical trials is the ability to participate anywhere, regardless of proximity to a clinical trial site. However, some interventions, labs or other form of data collection may be required in person.\n\nConnected systems and new partnerships with community providers will allow researchers to create “hot sites,” such as within a retail pharmacy, allowing patients to go to a nearby facility equipped to support their requirements for participation. Reducing the burden on patients to drive hours to a trial site improves the odds that they’ll stay in the study and increases the opportunity to diversify study populations.\n\n\nAlthough taking some portions or all of a clinical trial virtual might seem like a less personal approach to research, [leveraging digital technology to engage with patients](https://www.cognizant.com/perspectives/it-takes-a-village-to-humanize-the-clinical-trial-experience) can help form an equally deep connection. With the possibility of new sensors and data collection methods, modes of patient communication, and community partnerships, these technology advances will serve as the foundation for expanding implementation of decentralized clinical trials in 2021 and well into the future.\n\nCognizant CTO Babak Hodjat on AI and Contextualizing Data - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of eWEEK.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS7Gsxkq91f-FgKjnstlE5g?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cognizant.com%2F)\n\neWEEK.com\n\n1.49K subscribers\n\n[Cognizant CTO Babak Hodjat on AI and Contextualizing Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTnEbmwfAlI)\n\neWEEK.com\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nFull screen is unavailable.

workplace\n\n![Three leadership lessons for the post-COVID workplace](https://cognizant.scene7.com/is/image/cognizant/Codex-6753-Leadership-lessons-blog-banner-1200x500?wid=1600&fit=wrap)\n\nJune 29, 2021\n\n##### Three leadership lessons for the post-COVID workplace\n\n**Leaders shouldn’t act as though the changes of the last year didn’t occur. Here are three new leadership behaviors to embrace — permanently.**\n\n[Visit our Diversity & Inclusion webpage](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/about-cognizant/diversity-and-inclusion)\n\n* * *\n\nAlthough no one’s quite sure what the post-pandemic workplace will ultimately look like, one thing is already clear: How I manage my teams and interact with my supervisors has changed for the better — and, I believe, permanently. By adapting to [the new dynamics driven by the pandemic](https://digitally.cognizant.com/lets-use-the-pandemic-as-a-turning-point-for-diversity-and-gender-equality-codex6548), leaders can better support their teams and generate results.\n\nEven as a seasoned home-office worker, I found plenty to learn as the work-from-home environment suddenly went global and opened a window into the human side of business. Co-workers attended meetings with babies in their laps — and didn’t feel compelled to apologize. Through the pandemic, we learned that everyone needs a little grace, even when an urgent deadline is looming.\n\nHere are three lessons from the events of 2020 that leaders can put into action:\n\n1. **Remember that communication really matters.** With the pandemic, social unrest and economic upheaval all happening over the last year, the pressure often felt intense. It was a relief for employees to hear from corporate and team leaders in all-hands company emails, acknowledging that although we’re in a tough space, we’re all in this together. These emails were more detailed than in the past, and they often included resources such as webinars, support groups and counseling.\n\n\n\n\nThe lesson here is, don’t ignore what’s happening to your staff. We all know there’s work to do, and it’s important work, but employees need to be acknowledged as real people.\n\nThe same human touch makes a difference in the everyday emails shared across teams. Although our work isn’t personal, the relationships are. When I’m delivering information regarding project due dates, I am very straightforward, but I also share something positive before I make an ask. I also tailor the information I share for quick and fluid processing. Some people only want bullet points; others prefer an entire spreadsheet. I deliver the information in the way that works best for them.\n\nAs leaders, we often underestimate our power to help make someone’s day better. When I end meetings by saying, “Make today amazing,” people invariably pause and smile. Make sure your message isn’t always about the bottom line. “Thank you, we see you, and we value you” goes a long way.\n\n2. **Recognize the productivity boost that comes when you acknowledge everyone’s human side.** The biggest surprise of 2020 is how simply recognizing the human aspect can boost team productivity because it lets people find space and take a deep breath. I’m working more than I was 16 months ago, but the company’s offer of schedule tweaking — in this case, taking off every other Friday — has given me a more balanced home life. Having flex time when I need it has made a big difference for my four children and, as a result, has made me more productive. By attending to the human side, organizations get much more in return.\n\nThe benefits of that give-and-take ripple through to our home lives, too. Like many who worked from home offices pre-pandemic, my workspace suddenly became my family’s study area when our local schools closed. The nuances of my open-door policy became part of our new togetherness: When my office door is closed, do not disturb.\n\nOne of my sons made me a “Meeting in Progress” sign to hang on the door. The understanding and generosity at the heart of that gesture helped us all relax and make the best of a challenging time. My kids learned that while mom needs to work, I’m always there for them.\n\n3. **Accept that workplace attitudes have changed.** The changes I’ve experienced personally are permanent, and I’m guessing that’s true for others, as well. The pandemic taught me that, yes, there’s always work to do, but family is non-negotiable. In my case, my manager understood that as long as my family is settled, I’ll be my best at work. Everyone’s motivation is a little different, however; take time to understand what fuels the people who work with and for you.\n\n\nIt’s not an option to act as though the changes of the last year didn’t occur. Leaders must find a way to harness change and evolve as circumstances dictate. Although we’re all moving at the speed of digital, we’re still whole people who need balance in our lives — and we’re looking to leadership to help get us there.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n##### Ladawna Cole\n\nGlobal Brand & Creative Consult\n\n![Picture of  DIgitally Cognizant author Ladawna](https://s7ap1.scene7.com/is/image/cognizant/Ladawna-Headshot-150x150)\n\n* * *\n\nLaDawna Cole is a Senior Principal Consult in Cognizant's Global Brand and Creative group.

Use its products and services? Walk into its store? Update its app? Reach out to the contact center? This is the customer experience: all the elements of a customer’s interactions with a company, emphasis on all. And that’s what, increasingly, defines the brand.\n\nIn the past, a brand existed in the minds of consumers largely through the messages sent through advertising, media and marketing. Today, a brand’s promise is primarily manifested in the experiences the brand enables. Consequently, success hinges on how those experiences are managed — how they’re unified for the customer and, in turn, how the brand’s organizational capabilities are unified to deliver the experience.\n\nWhile companies grasp the importance of experience, however, few are addressing it holistically. In a recent [Forrester Consulting study](https://www.design-exceptional-experiences.com/forrester/) (requires login), 95% of respondents believe improving customer experience is either important or very important, but only 18% are prioritizing and investing in it enough to be getting real business results.\n\n#### It’s an experience economy\n\nThe impact of today’s “experience economy” will only grow with time — yet if you tried to list the established brands competing and winning on the experience they deliver, you probably couldn't name more than 10. We think that’s because organizations are thinking about experience in a fragmented way.\n\nPerhaps most businesses think experience revolves around delivering a quality product. Or that experience is equivalent to design — the way a product, website, store or mobile app works. They might think experience is defined by a technical platform like CRM, or a data platform that offers a 360-degree view of the consumer. Perhaps they think it’s the contact center…\n\nIn fact, though, it's none of these things, or rather all of them. Experience is how every last one of the interactions consumers have with a company makes them feel.\n\nWhile thinking about customer experience in this way can be liberating, it’s also challenging. That’s because to achieve a consistent, predictable, satisfying ongoing experience for customers, brands need to orchestrate more elements than most companies recognize.\n\nFor this reason, we believe tomorrow’s brand leaders will be those that systematize experience delivery. We call this “experience orchestration” — creating a multilayered ecosystem that reliably and repeatably delivers the desired experience across business units, media, devices, geographies and customer contexts.\n\n#### How companies look at experience\n\nOur Forrester study asked over 700 business and experience leaders to identify the practices and attitudes that lead to business success through customer experience. Among the most compelling findings: Companies almost never fully own the experiences they deliver. Instead, employees, partners and even customers themselves deliver major components of that experience.\n\nThe study also revealed the emphasis that leading companies place on the role of employees in creating the customer experience. They often consider the employee’s journey to be as important as, and also deeply connected with, the customer’s, and they incorporate this vision into their planning. These companies provide more and better technology to employees, ensure they have easy access to customer data, work to understand the mechanics of employee-customer engagement, view employee enablement as critical to customer success, and seek to use ongoing insights to improve how employees serve customers.\n\nEmployees are only one key element in the ecosystem that leads to powerful customer experiences, but their central role underscores the complex challenges involved with achieving success, and the need for companies to think in terms of entire systems.\n\n#### Orchestrating the experience\n\nWhen working with clients, we seek to marry the science of intimacy with the art of industrialization. In other words, brands not only need to understand the drivers of consumer preference; they also need to meet these preferences across channels, time and contexts — consistently, relevantly, repeatably and in whatever way customers choose to interact. Informed by our experience blueprint methodology, we enable our clients to efficiently scale valuable and valued experiences across their marketing, sales and service needs.\n\nIn just one example of experience orchestration, we’re helping a large European financial services company redesign its employee and customer experience. The business is shifting from an organization with 34 different products and six business units, to a customer-centric model based on 11 connected customer journeys. To ensure efficient, connected and consistent delivery of these journeys, we mapped each of them down through the organization’s key operating layers — the employee experience, the customer data, the technology platform and the business processes.\n\nEqually, for a large prestigious automotive company, we’ve helped improve the customer and dealer experience by designing a new and streamlined interaction model that we enabled through a custom interaction platform. The combination of intimacy and industrialization enables improved customer acquisition and relationships at a lower cost per sale.\n\nThroughout this and our other client engagements, technology is, of course, indispensable; however, we believe the brands that succeed will be those that ultimately bring the brand to life in a human way. Doing so requires listening intently, being empathetic and modulating your interactions based on changing signals from the customer — in short, using advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning to enable your brand to behave more like a human at a scale that no human can.\n\n#### Not just ‘what’ but also ‘how’\n\nOver half a century ago, Marshall McLuhan said, “ [The medium is the message](https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf).” This idea can and should be applied to customer experience; in other words, how the experience is delivered is the experience. The fact is, consumers and employees will have an experience with your brand — and by taking a holistic approach to the design and delivery of that experience, you give yourself the best chance to influence how they feel about it afterwards.\n\nDelivering an intimate-feeling experience at scale needs to be a top agenda item for the entire C-suite, from the CIO’s strategic plan to the CFO’s spending priorities. In the end, the brand experience infiltrates the organization itself, and will drive success going forward.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n##### Cognizant Insights Team\n\n![Cognizant](https://cognizant.scene7.com/is/image/cognizant/cognizant-insights-team-author-square)\n\n* * *\n\nWe’re here to offer you practical and unique solutions to today’s most pressing technology challenges.

But reducing the number of third-party service providers doesn’t have to be the drag on resources that most leaders expect.\n\nBy dispelling the myths about vendor consolidation, financial services providers can not only take a proactive approach to paring down their external partners; they can also realize a host of benefits, including efficiency, an improved technology stack and cost savings that free up funds for innovation investments.\n\n#### Triggers for vendor consolidation\n\nVendor consolidation is often a cyclical process: In a healthy economy, banks and card companies loosen the reins and expand their partner portfolios; when the economy contracts, they cut back.\n\nBut banks encounter other triggers as well, including:\n\n- **Realignment of teams and distribution of work** resulting from the move to Agile software development\n\n- **Aging technology infrastructures** that slow innovation and time to market\n\n- **Strategies** **that are in flux**, such as those for cloud and other platforms\n\n- **Regulatory scrutiny,** such as the third-party vendor management requirements of the FDIC, Federal Reserve and others\n\n[Black swan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp) events are also a trigger, and the pandemic has been no exception. As the emphasis on remote work and digital capabilities heightened banks’ and card companies’ awareness of security issues, the risks of multi-vendor environments became a greater cause for concern.\n\nA [pre-pandemic survey](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/06/12/cutting-complexity-to-strengthen-security-why-consolidation-matters/) found 69% of global security leaders agreed that prioritizing vendor consolidation would result in better security. In the post-COVID economy, interest in consolidation continues to rise: A [2021 survey](https://www.everestgrp.com/2021-04-https-www-everestgrp-com-2021-04-service-provider-portfolio-strategies-less-is-more-in-the-next-normal-blog-html-.html) found that 76% of companies polled plan to change their service provider portfolios.\n\n#### Dispelling consolidation myths\n\nNot that vendor consolidation is easy. Each organization needs its own tailored process for identifying the smallest number of vendors that will enable it to balance risk and service delivery, especially as banks go toe-to-toe with fintechs, big tech (think [Amazon](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/04/30/is-amazon-building-the-next-generation-bank/?sh=2b26e2f77ddd) and [Apple](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-apple-card-and-what-does-it-offer/)) and now retailers [Walgreen’s and Walmart](https://www.fastcompany.com/90658779/how-walgreens-and-walmarts-new-banking-ventures-will-shake-up-finance).\n\nIn our work with banking clients, we see several myths that hold banks back from pursuing consolidation and reaping the benefits it can provide:\n\n- **Myth #1: Working with fewer partners erodes the bank’s purchase power.**\n\n\n\n\n**The reality:** Business leaders might believe a large portfolio of vendor partners leads to increased competition and greater bargaining power for financial and terms negotiations. But the risk to banks’ competitiveness from relying on an array of often niche skillsets and vendor-specific technologies typically far outweighs any perceived gains in purchase power.\n\n\n\n\nBy concentrating purchases among fewer vendors, banks not only nurture a healthy, competitive multi-vendor environment, but they also spend more and become higher value clients, thus building more in-depth relationships with selected partners and positioning themselves to negotiate more favorable terms.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, when a multinational financial services company we work with decided to reduce the number of its vendor partners by 20%, it advised internal teams to increase communication with the remaining vendors as part of the consolidation review. It recommended biweekly or monthly check-ins with vendors to ensure clear expectations on strategic commitments.\n\n\n\n\nThe additional clarity enabled the vendors to structure new master agreements that aligned with the client’s goals and were supportive of a long-term partnership. The streamlined portfolio enabled the company to sharpen its strategy and give partners the opportunity to earn a larger share of the pie.\n\n\n- **Myth #2: If you wait long enough, you might not have to consolidate.**\n\n\n\n\n**The reality:** Vendor consolidations are often multi-year efforts, and some executives may hope that consolidation decisions will be reversed or delayed so they can avoid the issue completely.\n\n\n\n\nYet procrastinating only results in smaller windows of time to address stakeholder needs, potentially setting the stage for the disorder that can mar last-minute consolidation attempts.\n\n\n\n\nThe most successful vendor consolidations are faced head-on, with well-articulated decisions, executive buy-in and a timeline that keeps the initiative moving. The timeline is key because the sooner the consolidation is executed, the faster the intended ROIs can be accomplished.\n\n\n\n\nReturns can be substantial: Gartner [reports](https://www.gartner.com/en/doc/3722218-drive-cost-optimization-and-efficiencies-with-it-vendor-portfolio-rationalization) that, by rationalizing its portfolio, one large company reduced the number of vendors by 25% and netted an annual savings of 20%. As banks transition to technology companies, that’s a significant savings they can invest in other areas.\n\n\n- **Myth #3: Consolidation is a technology initiative that only benefits IT.**\n\n\n\n\n**The reality:** IT plays a significant role in vendor consolidations, but the benefits extend to business functions and units as well. A streamlined partner portfolio optimizes operations enterprise-wide and primes companies for growth.\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s more, the business-wide benefits are as relevant for fintechs as for incumbent banks. For example, we partnered with a fintech that relied on 15 vendors to operate its merchant services platform. The platform is a workhorse that processes 170 million authorizations worth $40 billion daily. By consolidating to one prime partner and adopting an outcomes-based delivery model, the fintech gained a more modern, efficient platform.\n\n\n\n\nEqually important, the benefits reached across the enterprise, including customer experience, which improved as a result of new onboarding practices and end-to-end support that resulted from the streamlining.\n\n- **Myth #4: Vendor consolidation creates chaos.**\n\n\n\n\n**The reality:** Vendor consolidation does indeed bring organizational changes. Yet choosing the right vendor partners also empowers the organization to meet its consolidation goals without the chaos.\n\n\n\n\nLook for prospective partners that understand your bank’s business, have a proven track record of delivery and can work with you to identify opportunities, quantify ROI and drive business outcomes. With the right partners, consolidation can be an orderly process.\n\n\n\n\nWithin the span of five months, a bank we partnered with successfully transitioned its multi-vendor merchant platform to a single-source, outcomes-based business model.\n\n\nAmid today’s uncertainty and complexity, banks and card companies can introduce simplicity and certainty into their operations by paring down their vendor partnerships. By doing so, they can realize both economic and business performance benefits that will resonate far into the future.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n##### Cognizant Insights Team\n\n![Cognizant](https://cognizant.scene7.com/is/image/cognizant/cognizant-insights-team-author-square)\n\n* * *\n\nWe’re here to offer you practical and unique solutions to today’s most pressing technology challenges.

By pulling a thread on what we know now about our “new normal” and considering what may come later as a result, various thought leaders from within Cognizant and beyond help us peek into the future of families, work, economic structures, life itself and more._\n\nThere’s a scene in the 2013 sci-fi romantic comedy [_Her_](https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/her) that captures where artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistants (VA) are heading. Set just over the horizon in futuristic Los Angeles, the film chronicles the lonely life of techno-nerd Theodore Twombly, who makes a living writing personal letters for people unable to effectively express themselves. Twombly acquires a new AI operating system designed to act as his VA.\n\nDepressed and reeling from the breakup of his marriage, Twombly immediately falls head over heels for his VA, Samantha. “I can’t believe I am having a conversation with my computer,” he reveals to Samantha during their initial rendezvous. To which she responds: “You’re not, you’re talking to me.”\n\nIn a click or two, Apple and Amazon and Google (and every other tech vendor worth its salt) will have Samantha-like capabilities embedded as their UX, and digits will be well on their way to becoming superfluous in a digital age.\n\nClearly, it will take enormous algorithmic smarts to imbue VAs with anthropomorphic fidelity. But that’s the arms race of 2020-2025.\n\n#### What the future sounds like\n\nA world of Samanthas and Siris and Alexas (and every other old-fashioned Victorian name you care to resurrect from the pages of Dickens and Hardy — “Hey, Charity Picksniff — order my usual pizza, will you?”) may seem unsettling at first, but by mid-decade, they will be as normal as ATMs, contactless payments and in-car head-up displays.\n\nIn another click or two, Samantha (or Charity) will change on-the-fly depending on our mood, circumstance and, of course, need. Women could opt for male voices, if desired. Men could keep their female VAs with the lilting intonation that rises at the close of each statement that Siri made famous. Or you’ll talk to a George (Clooney) in the morning and a Nicole (Kidman) in the evening — celebrities will, of course, monetize their velvet tones with digital rights management deals.\n\nAnd then, in a further click or three, VAs will truly read our minds — not only finishing our sentences but also proactively anticipating our every need, want and desire (hopefully, within reason), even overruling us, where necessary — or at least where human intelligence falls short of the mark.\n\nAs HAL, the seemingly omniscient supercomputer from the sci-fi thriller [_2001: A Space Odyssey_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/) warned us when his cognition differed from his human companion: “I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.” With more precise algorithmic thinking, VAs that can countermand are not too far away. With a smile or a scowl, or a countenance that augments their purpose and conveys understanding that transcends the spoken word, e.g., in an entirely anthropomorphic way, their voices will fill our minds, and our future.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n##### Cognizant Insights Team\n\n![Cognizant](https://cognizant.scene7.com/is/image/cognizant/cognizant-insights-team-author-square)\n\n* * *\n\nWe’re here to offer you practical and unique solutions to today’s most pressing technology challenges.

Five Blues plans hope so. In June, they announced the [launch of Evio](https://www.evio.com/#news), whose goal is to “change the trajectory” of pharmaceutical pricing. The [for-profit company plans to leverage depersonalized aggregated data](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/five-blues-plans-launch-evio-profit-company-focused-lowering-drug-prices) from 20 million Blues members to measure the effectiveness of prescription drugs, thus arming payers with negotiating power with drug makers.\n\nIn a similarly motivated move, Anthem and Humana have [invested almost $140 million into a new pharmacy benefit manager](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/anthem-and-humana-enter-multi-million-agreement-ssc-api-cloud-platform) (PBM), called DomaniRx. Eighty percent owned by fintech SS&C Technologies, DomaniRx will combine that company’s claims processing platform with analytics to give payers more transparency into their drug costs.\n\nBoth efforts reflect steadily growing pressure from employers, consumers and regulators to control their Rx spend. The question prospective customers of Evio and DomaniRx should ask is whether these ventures offer significant new value or just simplify the complex relationships among health plans, PBMs, pharmaceutical manufacturers and patients.\n\n#### Assessing the latest moves to reduce Rx spend\n\nHere are some factors to consider:\n\n- **Many payers already own or contract with PBMs.** PBMs are supposed to negotiate advantageous pricing for their clients. Evio CEO Hank Schlissberg says Evio is not designed to cut out the middleman role of PBMs — yet. So why did the Blues need to create a new entity to aggregate and analyze prescription utilization data? Couldn’t they have just worked with PBMs to do so?\n\n\n\nOne answer may be that PBMs are not always incented to include lower cost drugs on their formularies. PBMs receive rebates from pharma manufacturers that are based on the drug’s list price. This practice ends up being a disincentive to promoting cheaper drugs that don’t offer rebates. Whether that’s occurring and leading to greater use of higher cost drugs can be opaque to health insurers and employers.\n\n\n\nPayers that choose to participate in Evio will want to examine the company’s reimbursement structure, such as flat fee, percentage of savings, total drug cost or some combination, and ensure they are not paying their PBM or another entity for the same work. If that work is carved out, a PBM might raise its prices to offset that loss. Payers may also need to renegotiate their PBM contracts if their existing agreements do not require the PBMs to provide data to third parties such as Evio.\n\n\n\n\nAs direct contracting grows between payers and drug manufacturers, PBMs will need to create a new value proposition. One idea is to enhance their drug utilization management programs. PBMs could require updated lab values when reviewing prior authorization requests and monitor adherence and results through refill and lab data. By combining this data with their clinical information, payers could get better insights into how adherence affects medical results.\n\n- **Payers already have their own pharmacy and medical data to analyze and use in direct contracting with pharma companies**. Most payers have massive quantities of data that can be depersonalized and aggregated to study the efficacy of a given drug. Highmark, an investor in Evio, already has direct contracts with manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\nEvio implies its advantage will be economies of scale, as it can aggregate data from its 20 million members spread across five health payers initially, with possibly more to come if Evio opens to other payers. These data volumes should provide the company with better evidence about drug efficacy that either it or its clients could use to negotiate prices with manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\nIf Evio were to broker performance-based payments on behalf of many payers, manufacturers might prefer working through one company to administer them. Such an arrangement would be more efficient than setting up and maintaining individual value-based arrangements with multiple plans.\n\n\n\n\nIn that scenario, though, larger payers may receive preferential pricing because of their member numbers. That raises ethical questions. If it becomes known throughout the industry that Drug X performs well with a specific patient cohort, should its performance-based pricing vary with payer size? Will demand for that specific drug drive up its cost, or will manufacturers net sufficient return on higher volumes?\n\n\n\n\nIf smaller payers share data with Evio or a similar company, they should ensure they receive the same agreement with manufacturers that larger payers do, simply by virtue of their participation. Their resource investment in data sharing likely would be equal to or even disproportionately larger than that of a larger payer and should be rewarded.\n\n- **Health data is poised to flow more freely as interoperability opens industry data silos**. It’s not clear whether Evio’s findings will be available to all payers or just participating Blues plans. Another question is whether Evio will use existing industry data standards such as [NCPDP](http://www.ncpdp.org/) or [FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/summary.html) to collect data. It would be a step backward for a new entrant to create a proprietary data format when the industry is on the cusp of [true data interoperability](https://www.cognizant.com/perspectives/privacy-and-consent-implementing-the-cornerstones-of-interoperability-on-a-flexible-foundation).\n\n\n#### A different approach to lowering Rx costs\n\nRather than waiting for these questions to be answered, payers can choose to function in the same way that Evio hopes to by drawing on their existing data to contract directly with manufacturers. Here’s how:\n\n- **Target specific drug classes and disease states**. Payers could focus on gathering information related to expensive specialty drugs, such as for statin-resistant cholesterol, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis (MS), cancers and rare conditions. Most payers will want to see evidence that a drug therapy reduces medical costs associated with these health issues.\n\n- **Collect the right data**. Be specific about the data required to evaluate drug performance when setting up preauthorization criteria for pricey specialty drugs. To create MS member cohorts and monitor the results of their drug therapies, for example, payers would need specifics such as type of MS, gender, age of disease onset, current age, mobility measures, etc.\n\n- **Analyze the results**. Manufacturers can provide expected results data, such as percentage of MS relapses. If the projected results aren’t aligned with clinical and financial evidence, then manufacturers could adjust payments or issue refunds. The industry could use the existing drug rebate reconciliation framework for these adjustments. Being transparent with employers and members about these results can build trust.\n\nThis is not to say value-based prescription drug arrangements will be painless. Including medications traditionally covered under the medical benefit could lead to changes in existing provider agreements, benefit structures, financial accounting and underwriting.\n\nPayers will also need to plan responses if the data shows poor clinical results. Conversely, if data points to a therapy being especially effective, how will payers work with members and physicians to ethically promote that therapy?\n\nRegardless of how Evio performs, payers have the data and PBM partners to shift their own drug spending trajectories. Getting control over costs while delivering evidence-backed quality should net out to happier, healthier members and a strong competitive advantage.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n##### Laura Topor\n\nHealthcare/Pharmacy Consultant\n\n![Picture of DIgitally Cognizant author Laura Topor](https://cognizant.scene7.com/is/image/cognizant/Laura-Topor-headshot-150x150%20(1))\n\n* * *\n\nLaura Topor is Sr Manager, Healthcare/Pharmacy, Cognizant Consulting. She has experience in pharmacy benefits management, payer & provider ops, health IT, e-prescribing, regulatory compliance, process improvement & strategic planning.\n\n[Laura.Topor@cognizant.com](mailto:Laura.Topor@cognizant.com)\n\nFollow\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauratopor/)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n##### Latest posts\n\nThe enterprise knowledge paradox: Why your organization knows everything but can't remember any of it.\n\n\n[Know more](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/insights/insights-blog/building-autonomous-knowledge-networks-for-organizational-memory)\n\n* * *\n\nThe technology can add detail and granularity to a process that is often outdated.

Now, though, another crucial element is impacting the sports industry: data. Instead of eroding the inherently human qualities of playing and watching sports, though, data is enhancing them, enabling leagues and teams to capitalize on the direct-to-consumer (DTC) model and attract more players and fans. By promoting the excitement of sports, leagues and teams also gain big business outcomes through an improved fan experience.\n\nMost leagues and teams are rookies at tackling data and managing fan relationships. They also face a DTC pipeline that’s more fragmented than in other industries, featuring multiple stakeholders with hugely varying needs that rely on different platforms and channels.\n\nFor example, while some fans consume sports through streaming services and traditional broadcast channels, others purchase tickets through stadiums and web-based ticket services. Enthusiasts shop for merchandise at online and physical stores. Teams share performance analytics in one form for coaches and players, and another for fans. Segmentation and personalization are highly complex.\n\nWhat’s more, the sports industry faces stiff competition from the entertainment sector for consumers’ time and attention. The biggest competitors for leagues and teams aren’t necessarily other sports but YouTube and Netflix. They’re in a competition for eyeballs.\n\n#### The role of personalization\n\nCapitalizing on DTC means hyper-personalization on steroids. In the UK, the Football Association (FA) is the governing body for all of football, and it manages a diversity of revenue and stakeholders that includes not only grassroots, senior and professional teams but also 90,000-seat [Wembley Stadium](https://www.wembleystadium.com/). After a year of cancelled matches and limited play, the FA is putting data to work to coax people back into the game — and seeing big gains.\n\nTo make it happen, it’s relying on a [next-generation engagement platform](https://www.cognizant.com/case-studies/pdfs/englands-football-association-increases-fan-engagement-to-make-football-for-all-codex6765.pdf) that we created to power tailored messaging for the FA’s many stakeholders. For example, to feed the association’s need for building elite women’s and men’s senior leagues, we developed a digital app for pre-teens and teenagers that offers engagement tools such as online gaming and social media to successfully compete for their attention.\n\nThe FA’s future vision includes serving up real-time analytics during matches, offering data-hungry fans on-field performance details like the latest stats on England captain Harry Kane.\n\nIt’s personalization at its most complex, and the FA is already seeing results. An initiative that encourages young girls to join football clubs resulted in 60,000 new participants, according to the FA. In addition, its new stadium hub triggered a 25% jump in youth registration for ticket sales, the FA notes. Through the next-gen platform, the FA expects to manage 1.5 million players this year.\n\n#### Breaking through barriers\n\nThe FA isn’t alone in taking a deep dive into personalization. Legendary Formula 1 racing champion and automaker Aston Martin is looking to target and nurture a diverse racing fanbase in addition to the high-net-worth individuals who buy its iconic cars. Global racing competition SailGP is similarly looking to broaden its followers. (Cognizant is a [sponsor](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/about-cognizant/sponsorships) for both organizations.)\n\nBoth motorsports and sailing face the same hurdle: Opportunities to engage are limited compared with other sports. While it’s easy to start kicking around a ball, barriers to entry are much higher for getting behind the wheel or on the water.\n\nEngaging and expanding the fanbase is key for both sports. To connect fans with a product they can identify with and consume, Aston Martin is exploring development of custom fan experiences tailored to individual interests. For example, it hopes to use data to create one experience for fans who are longtime admirers of the brand and focused on this season’s car and engineering feats, and another for those who are, say, avid followers of driver Sebastian Vettel. (Click [here](https://www.cognizant.com/aston-martin-cognizant-formula-one) for more details on how Cognizant is partnering with Aston Martin to modernize its business.)\n\nAnd then there’s the power of convergence: Nielsen [attributes](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/research-says-f1-could-reach-1bn-fans-in-2022/5900701/) its prediction for big growth in F1’s fanbase not only to Netflix’s popular series [_Formula 1: Drive to Survive_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890) but also to young drivers’ presence on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.\n\nWe’re also partnering with SailGP to improve audience insights and enable data visualization. Our team is leading a CRM implementation to help SailGP manage fan data in a single database and communicate better with fans to deepen engagement and increase the  viewing audience. To capture the exhilaration of sailing in one of the race’s hydrofoil-supported catamarans, SailGP’s plans to include an immersive fan experience that shares real-time metrics such as sailors' heart rate and supercharged boat speeds that can [break 50 knots](https://apnews.com/article/86414d73282c4fea8d991ec3f91b96b6) as the catamarans [fly above the water](https://www.rockwool.com/group/about-us/racing/beneath-the-surface/articles/how-the-worlds-fastest-sail-racing-boats-fly-above-the-water/).\n\n#### Standing out in the world of entertainment\n\nFor the sometimes insular world of sports, DTC and personalization are about much more than technology. They require a mindset shift for leagues and teams as they take on increasing responsibility for fan relationships and experiences.\n\nMonetization is a motivator, but so is necessity. As viewers face a tidal wave of content and entertainment options, mastering sports’ changing playbook is helping leagues and teams to stay in the mix.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n##### David Ingham\n\nClient Partner, Media, Entertainment & Sport\n\n![Picture of  DIgitally Cognizant author David Ingham](https://s7ap1.scene7.com/is/image/cognizant/David-Ingham-Headshot-150x150)\n\n* * *\n\nDavid Ingham is a Cognizant Client Partner for Media, Entertainment & Sport.
